== ABOUT ==

It's a simple ircbot i wrote because some people wanted a !seen bot in their channel. 
 
I've made it easy for myself to add modules to it so i'm sure others can do it to. 
I will be adding some more modules to it soon because they wanted some game or 
something and i'm pretty bored. 

Maybe an info module to later, where you can save strings and fetch them with keywords. 

It uses ndbm which i have available on FreeBSD where i wrote it. I've only tested it 
on FreeBSD so if you have any problems, holla at me and i'll see if i can help. 

Have fun!

== COMPILING ==

To compile just run this on the command line;
./configure && gmake

You don't have to run the configure script, all it does is test for setproctitle on your 
system. If you skip it then just run `cp Makefile.in Makefile` and you're good to go. 

This requires GNU Make, it's often installed as gmake but can also be the default make. 

You can't recompile just the modules yet but you can clean shit up with `gmake clean`. 

The leave module uses setproctitle, If available, so you can define SETPROCTITLE in 
the Makefile or CFLAGS to compile the modules with it. If you have setproctitle it 
is highly recommended, just check if you have it's manual with `man 3 setproctitle`.
`setenv CFLAGS -DSETPROCTITLE` in tcsh or just edit the Makefile

Then just run ./bicebot and read some help info. A good example would 
be: ./bicebot -c #channel -n bicebot irc.server.tld

== MODULES ==

You can write your own modules, but if you want your own license you have to append it 
to the top of each module you write. Check out the smaller modules for examples, i wrote 
them to help people understand how simple it is.
