# Project imported from Google Code

This is an old project from around January 2008 that I had left on Google Code when said repository host went bust this week. 

So here it is, imported manually because the export-to-github tool refused to work, likely because I had no actual source code on Google Code. 

The branch, when I imported it, was from the 0.6b tarball at Google Code. 

I remember this project for the following attributes

  * Memory leaks
  * My first real C project
  * My first time with autoconf
  * My first time using dlopen, in fact the project was partly inspired by me having read the Apache Httpd source for loading modules
